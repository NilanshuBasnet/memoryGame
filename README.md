# Memory Game  

An interactive and customizable Memory Game built with **React**. This project was inspired by the [‚ÄúReact JS Interview Questions (Memory Game)‚Äù tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84o1kuPuYdU&list=WL) by *RoadsideCoder*.  

## Features  
- **Dynamic Grid Size:** Users can select board dimensions ranging from 2x2 to 10x10.  
- **Randomized Gameplay:** Cards are shuffled to provide a unique experience in every session.  
- **Interactive Mechanics:** Flip cards, match pairs, and solve the puzzle with smooth animations.  
- **Responsive Design:** Built using Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience across devices.  

## Technologies Used  
- **React**: For building the interactive user interface.  
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for game functionality.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling the application with a responsive and modern design.  

## Usage  

1. Select the grid size by entering a number between 2 and 6 in the input field.  
2. Click the **Play** button to shuffle the cards and start the game.  
3. Flip the cards by clicking on them to reveal the numbers.  
4. Match pairs of cards with the same number to solve the puzzle.  
5. Continue until all pairs are matched to win the game!
